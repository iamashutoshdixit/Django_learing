Introduction
This repo is all about my exploration of Django. From basic app creation to more advanced topics like Django Rest Framework, this will serve as a reference for everything I've learned. It's a place to experiment, break things, and learn!

My Learning Goals
Get comfortable with setting up Django projects and apps.
Understand models, views, and templates (MVT architecture).
Learn how to work with databases, including migrations and queries.
Dive into Django Rest Framework (DRF) for API development.
Explore user authentication, forms, and advanced features like middleware.
Build a few small projects to solidify the concepts.
Getting Started
To get started with the code in this repo, clone it to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/iamashutoshdixit/Django_learing.git
cd django-learning
Project Structure
The structure of this repo is simple for now, but it may evolve as I add more:

bash
Copy code
/django-learning/
├── /tutorials/         # Step-by-step tutorials as I progress
├── /projects/          # Mini-projects to apply my learning
├── /exercises/         # Practice exercises for specific concepts
├── /static/            # Static files (CSS, JS, etc.)
├── /templates/         # HTML templates for the apps
└── README.md           # This file
Prerequisites
For this learning project, I'm using:

Python (3.7+)
Django (4.0+)
pip for dependency management
Git for version control
If I need any specific libraries, I'll document them in requirements.txt.

Installation
Set up a virtual environment to keep things organized:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
If there's no requirements.txt, Django can be installed manually:

bash
Copy code
pip install django
Running the Project
To run any project or tutorial, I'll use Django's built-in development server:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
This should spin up the server at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Resources
These are some of the resources I am using to learn Django:

Django Documentation
Django Rest Framework
Django YouTube tutorials
I'll keep adding more as I find helpful articles, videos, or books.

This repo will serve as my personal notebook for all things Django!
